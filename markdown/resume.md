> An Agricultural Engineer turned data scientist by crop yield modeling.
I started using machine learning studying the effects of spatial autocorrelation in empirical modeling of sugarcane yield. After that, in many different fields like coffee disease occurrence prediction and soil classification models.
Outside of agriculture, since every modern application uses lots of data, I’ve participated on projects on logistics transportation, car GPS tracking, students performance on online education and survey data analysis.

Education
---------

2018-2020 (expected)
:   **MSc, Data Science**; University of Campinas (Unicamp)

    *Tomato yield prediction and mass gain prediction using low cost sensors*

2012-2017
:   **BSc, Agricultural Engineering**; University of Campinas (Unicamp)


Experience
----------

2016-2017
:   **Research**: Bolsista de Iniciação Científica at CNPq

**Effects of spatial autocorrelation in crop yield modeling.** Ignoring spatial autocorrelation between observations, models severely underestimated the error in new data. Using blocks of observations based on location helps better estimate the prediction error in fields that were not used when building the models.

2016-2017
:   **Research**: Intern at Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation

**Alternatives for automatic soil classification**. Research on soil type classification using chemical and physical properties using decision trees.

We implemented a spatially-aware protocol and compared it with the naive approach of assuming independence between samples. The protocols were applied through all the model development pipeline: data splitting for hold-out sets, feature selection, cross-validation for model adjustment and model evaluation. Three different machine learning techniques were used to create models in each protocol. The resulting models were evaluated both in the validation set created by each protocol and in a manually created independent set. This independent set ensured there was no auto-correlation between the samples used for modeling. We showed that assuming independence when modeling yield leads to underestimating model errors and overfit during model adjustment.
